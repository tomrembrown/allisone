The purpose of this website is to help people find and connect with each other - to reduce the barriers that separate us - and reduce the illusion of separation.  Each person has a page. It has at a minimum, their first name and a single face picture. Other information can be entered later - and has privacy settings on it - allow only friends, allow only compatible ads to see this, allow everyone.
